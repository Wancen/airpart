Description: Airpart identifies sets of genes displaying differential
    cell-type-specific allelic imbalance across cell types
    or states, utilizing single-cell allelic counts. It makes use of a
    generalized fused lasso with binomial observations of allelic
    counts to partition cell types by their allelic
    imbalance. Alternatively, a nonparametric method for partitioning
    cell types is offered. The package includes a number of
    visualizations and quality control functions for examining single
    cell allelic imbalance datasets.
