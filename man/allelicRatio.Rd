\title{Fit betabinomial on each cell type groups}
\usage{
allelicRatio(
  sce,
  level = 0.95,
  method = c("Normal", "bootstrap"),
  R,
  ncores,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A SingleCellExperiment containing assays (\code{"ratio"},
\code{"counts"}) and colData (\code{"x"}, \code{"part"})}

\item{level}{the confidence interval required}

\item{method}{the method to used for construct confidence interval. The default is the first method.
"bootstrap" is likely to be more accurate especially when the data is highly overdispersed,
however it is computationally intensive.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates.}

\item{ncores}{integer: number of processes to be used in parallel operation.
Typically one would chose this to the number of available CPUs.}
